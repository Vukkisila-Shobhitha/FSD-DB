/register endpoint Frontend > user provides details [username, password, email] > clicks register button Backend > receives the details [username, password, email] > saves the details in the database

/login endpoint Frontend > user provides details [username, password] > clicks login button Backend > receives the details [username, password] > checks if the details are correct > sends a response [success or failure] > if success, set a httpOnly cookie with the token in the response > the cookie will then be set in the browser

If the user has already logged in or whenever logs in fresh, the browser will have the cookie with the token. The token has details like the user id, user name, and the expiry date.

for futher requests,

Frontend > User is in the dashboard page > clicks on the profile page > We need the data of the user > make an api call to the backend with the token in the cookie Backend > receives the request with the token > verifies the token > check if the token is valid and not expired > if valid, check who has sent the request > extract the user id from the token > using the token, it will get the user details from the database > sends the user details as a response

bcrypt - to hash the password (encrypt the password to store it securely in the database) jsonwebtoken - to generate the token(when the user logs in, a token will be generated and sent to the user) (so that the user can send the token in the header for further requests) morgan - to log the requests in the console mongoose - to interact with the MongoDB database dotenv - to store the environment variables cors - to enable cross-origin resource sharing cookie-parser - to parse the cookies in the request express - to create the server and manage the routes(because the nodejs server is low-level, and it will be difficult to manage the routes) nodemon - to restart the server automatically when there are changes in the code
